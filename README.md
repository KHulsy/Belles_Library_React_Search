# Google_Books_React_Search
Pick a book, any book. 
Abstract
I just lost my entire READ-ME. So that's fun. I looked over Jerome's code drills again. I used every file in the Google Books Activity. I played with time using React. All the moving parts are there except for the buttons. Forgive me, but the air quality is really bad because of the Los Angeles fires, and I've had some nauseau kicking for the last couple of days. I'm going to take a nap and then prettify this Read-Me.

Programs Used:
1. Mongoose
2. Google Books API
3. MAMP(not well...probably out of scope)
4. Terminal
5. Browser
6. Mac
7. NPM
8. Yarn

Acknowledgments: Jerome, and all faculty and ta's in the program. Thank you.
